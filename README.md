# TeamBusBoysProject
Team BusBoys created an application named BBTransit that tracks Atlanta's buses according to each bus' route number. The user is able to choose a stop according to the chosen route number. Once chosen a stop, the user is able to recieve an arrival time for that stop. That stop dictates the arrival time of the upcoming bus, and location of the user.

For this project, we have used PHP, CSX, HTML, and JavaScript languages. We used MySQL Workbench, and Sublime Text IDEs. In addition to these IDEs, the team chose to use Amazon Web Services' EC2 Host to host, and display our web browser.
